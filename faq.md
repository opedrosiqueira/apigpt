do the system_content property of the ChatCompletion API cosumes tokens?

The `system_content` property of the ChatCompletion API consumes tokens. The `system_content` is a parameter that you can use to provide any instructions or context to the model before generating a completion. This content is included in the token limit of the API and will affect the total number of tokens used for generating the response. Keep in mind that the available token limit varies depending on the API endpoint you are using.

If I am using a model with a maximum token limit of 4096, does this mean that both my question and your answer combined must be at most 4096 tokens, or can my question alone be 4096 tokens?

In the case where you are using a model with a maximum token limit of 4096, the combined total of both your question and the assistant's answer must not exceed 4096 tokens. This includes both input and output tokens.
